<p><img src="https://digitalprojects.brynmawr.edu/perryhousehistories/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AaliayhJosephPhoto-PH.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>From a young age, Aaliyah loved listening to other people’s stories. She has particularly interested in gathering tools to better analyze racialized objects, subject, history, and social justice starting in the 1960s. She turns to history and visual studies to not only measure preservation styles and historical context but also investigate literature and craft critically creative interpretations of memory. Being born and raised in Portland, OR, but currently residing on the East Coast, she is inspired to capture Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) in their authentic selves through supporting the radical questioning of dominant history. Community Archives use metadata from community historians, artists, and independents, are preserved and create powerful tools for empowerment and education. BIPOC folks have found particular advantages in the utilization of such archives. Her research is guided by the works of This research draws on the connection between the philosophies of Linda Tuhiwai Smith, Stephen Best, and Stuart Hall and findings of historian Andrew Flinn and varying artists. In order to emphasize the differing methods of information in the digital era, she aims to examine contemporary histories, engage with abject theory, connect people, affect, and story.</p>

<p><img src="https://digitalprojects.brynmawr.edu/perryhousehistories/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Janina-1024x1024.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Janina Calle is a senior at Bryn Mawr College pursuing a B.A. in International Studies with a concentration in migration. Her interest in International migration stems from having grown up in Trenton, NJ, an immigrant enclave, where she has learned about the different economic, political, and social factors that propel people to migrate. Inspired by her Ecuadorian upbringing and her parent’s migration story, Janina was motivated to pursue a semester abroad in Rabat, Morocco where she conducted an ethnographic study on “Transnational motherhood in Morocco.” In Rabat, she also studied migratory patterns in North Africa and Europe, in conjunction with taking Arabic language classes. During her summers, she interned with Juntos, an immigrant rights organization located in South Philadelphia and the ACLU-PA. Both organizations taught and allowed her to contribute to the community organizing and the legal efforts to protect human rights and civil liberties of immigrant communities in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>She is currently a student researcher with the Pensby Center for the “Preserving Perry House Oral History Project” where she has been able to listen and collect the oral histories of Black and latinx alums who have lived or experienced the Perry House, with the intentions of advancing the colleges’ archives collection. Janina will also be serving as the Career Peer Team Lead at the Career and Civic Engagement Center this upcoming academic year; she will assist students with career building-related inquires.</p>

<p>Janina hopes to continue her education in graduate school. In her free time, she enjoys reading revolutionary literature and discussing ways to dismantle systems of oppression with her friends.</p>

<p>I am a senior Chemistry major from Cambridge, Massachusetts. I work as a Community Diversity Assistant, Student Consultant for Centering Critical Blackness, and supervisor at Erdman Dining Hall. As a resident of Enid Cook Center, I have always been interested to learn more about the history of Perry House and how Enid Cook Center came to be. In the past, I have looked to Black at Bryn Mawr and casual conversations with alum to gain knowledge on the experiences of Black students, staff, and faculty. With the oral history project, I hope we can document a more complete history of our community.</p>
